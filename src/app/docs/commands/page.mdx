# Commands

Iroh commands are the primary API for interacting with an iroh node, implemented in numerous languages. This reference covers what commands do, with code examples. {{className: 'lead' }}


## Running the examples

Each language has it's own environment-specific setup that's assumed in each example:

<TabGroup>
  <div language='console' title='console'>

The console is the best way to learn the API without writing code, and serves double duty as a diagnostics tool when you're building applications. It's a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) that communicates with an iroh node for realtime updates.

For a tour of the console check out the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart). Start the console with the `iroh console` command:

```bash
$ iroh console
```

  </div>

  <div language='rust' title='rust'>

Add the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml {{ title: 'Cargo.toml' }}
[dependencies]
iroh = "0.1.0"
anyhow = "1.0.40"
futures = "0.3.15"
tokio = { version = "1.5.0", features = ["full"] }
```

All examples assume you're working in a `main.rs` file. Run the example with `cargo run`:

```bash {{ title: 'run' }}
$ cargo run
```
  </div>

  {/* <div language='python' title='python'>
Sup Python
  </div> */}
</TabGroup>
