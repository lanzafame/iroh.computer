# Running Examples

The console is the easiest way to interact with a running iroh node. It's a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) that communicates with an iroh node for realtime updates. {{className: 'lead' }}

This references includes both console command documentation, and examples showing how to replicate a console command in code. For a tour of the console check out the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart). Start the console with the `iroh console` command:

```bash
$ iroh
```
