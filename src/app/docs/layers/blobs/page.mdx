# Blobs

- blobs are just bytes
- bytes are "content-addressed": referred to by blake3 hash
- iroh has a protocol for fetching data

## Content Addressing

- Content addressing is using the hash of bytes as the identifier for bytes
- immutable: can't change the content without getting a new identifier
- mutable labels
- asking for content by it's hash means you can get it from anyone, because you can

## Blake3

- fast.
- works anywhere
- 

## Incremental Verification

- Confirming the data you've received is the data you've asked for _as you are getting it_
- Automatic change / corruption detection


## Data Transfer Protocol

- registers a QUIC ALPN specifically for transferring data
- supports multiple subsequence fetching
- protocol is request-response
- data is validated on receive _and_ send


## Storage
