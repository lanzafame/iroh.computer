# Quickstart

This guide will give you a quick tour of iroh from the command line. We'll create a document and sync it between to terminals. After that we'll look at where to go next to learn about how iroh works & where to integrate into your application. {{className: 'lead'}}

<Note>
  Iroh is currently in alpha release. We're aiming for Sept. 30th for a proper, production quality release of this same API the quickstart covers.
</Note>

## Install Iroh

The first thing you'll need to do is get the iroh CLI. Follow the instructions on our [install guide](/docs/install), then come back here.

<div className='not-prose'>
  <Button arrow="right" href="/docs/install">Install Iroh CLI</Button>
</div>

Confirm iroh works & is installed correctly by running `iroh help`. You should see help text that starts like this:

```text
$ iroh help
Iroh is a tool for syncing bytes.
https://iroh.computer/docs

Usage: iroh [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
...
```

## Start iroh

```text
$ iroh start
Listening addresses:
  108.41.41.113:52658
  108.41.41.113:11204
  192.168.86.28:11204
DERP Region: 1
PeerID: 3pwjma35aeu7mmmjolslefpnlsdztyp4zwf4zwx32nnvlmzko4aa
```

- This is a node. It's kinda like a combination database & web server
- PeerID identifies this node
- Listening Addresses
- DERP Region is for holepunching, see [here](/docs/connections/holepunching)

## Start the Console

Now that we hve a server running, let's create a document. We'll do that from the _console_. The console is a REPL that lets you talk to the node. We open the console with `iroh console`, connecting to the node we started with `iroh start`.

```text
$ iroh console
Welcome to the Iroh console!
Type `help` for a list of commands.

>
```

## Create an Author

Before we can work with documents, we need to create an _author_, which is an identity that will represent us while we work.

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```text
> author create
727565e2773f0cf6135bc4bb127fe6db3b5918085c06f968f57a50ac56605643
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Document

Next, let's create a document

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```text
> docs create
created fc16d6004586d124e3446a303236ccb7adb9bc671afb33b83c21b602772615e3
```
</CodeGroup>

Now let's set the author for this doc

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```text
> set-author
727565e2773f0cf6135bc4bb127fe6db3b5918085c06f968f57a50ac56605643
```
</CodeGroup>

## Set a value

Next let's set two values in the document:

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```
doc:7qlnmacf author:oj2wlytx
> set foo "bar"
@oj2wlytx…: foo = 6lujp3wx… (3B)
> set some/data.json 
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Second node

Now we need a second node to actually sync with. In another terminal, run:

```text
$ export IROH_DATA_DIR=./ && iroh start --rpc-port 1111
Listening addresses:
  108.41.41.113:47896
  108.41.41.113:62424
  192.168.86.28:62424
DERP Region: 1
PeerID: msiymgtbgosahfrcftazqcbpz7n54z2kol2rd653fin6gh4remmq
```

Iroh has a default data directory, and a default port ([`1337`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet))

We pass `IROH_DATA_DIR=./` as an environment variable,

<Note>
  To make this more interesting, try running this step on a separate computer
  Iroh's networking stack will establish a connection for you.
