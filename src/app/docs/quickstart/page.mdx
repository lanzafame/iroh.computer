# Quickstart

This guide will give you a quick tour of iroh from the command line. We'll create a document and sync it between to terminals. After that we'll look at where to go next to learn about how iroh works & where to integrate into your application. {{className: 'lead'}}

<Note>
  Iroh is currently in alpha release. We're aiming for Sept. 30th for a proper, production quality release of this same API the quickstart covers.
</Note>

## Install Iroh

The first thing you'll need to do is get the iroh CLI. Follow the instructions on our [install guide](/docs/install), then come back here.

<div className='not-prose'>
  <Button arrow="right" href="/docs/install">Install Iroh CLI</Button>
</div>

Confirm iroh works & is installed correctly by running `iroh help`. You should see help text that starts like this:

```text
$ iroh help
Iroh is a tool for syncing bytes.
https://iroh.computer/docs

Usage: iroh [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
...
```

## Start iroh

```text
$ iroh start
Listening addresses:
  108.41.41.113:52658
  108.41.41.113:11204
  192.168.86.28:11204
DERP Region: 1
PeerID: 3pwjma35aeu7mmmjolslefpnlsdztyp4zwf4zwx32nnvlmzko4aa
```

- This is a node. It's kinda like a combination database & web server
- PeerID identifies this node
- Listening Addresses
- DERP Region is for holepunching, see [here](/docs/connections/holepunching)

## Start the Console

Now that we hve a server running, let's create a document. We'll do that from the _console_. The console is a REPL that lets you talk to the node. We open the console with `iroh console`, connecting to the node we started with `iroh start`.

```text
$ iroh console
Welcome to the Iroh console!
Type `help` for a list of commands.

>
```

## Create an Author

Before we can work with documents, we need to create an _author_, which is an identity that will represent us while we work.

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```text
> author create
727565e2773f0cf6135bc4bb127fe6db3b5918085c06f968f57a50ac56605643
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Document

Next, let's create a document

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```text
> docs create
created fc16d6004586d124e3446a303236ccb7adb9bc671afb33b83c21b602772615e3
```
</CodeGroup>

Now let's set the author for this doc

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```text
> set-author
727565e2773f0cf6135bc4bb127fe6db3b5918085c06f968f57a50ac56605643
```
</CodeGroup>

## Set a value

Next let's set two values in the document:

<CodeGroup tag="CONSOLE">
```
doc:7qlnmacf author:oj2wlytx
> set foo "bar"
@oj2wlytx…: foo = 6lujp3wx… (3B)
> set some/data.json 
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Second node

Now we need a second node to actually sync with. In another terminal, run:

```text
$ export IROH_DATA_DIR=./ && iroh start --rpc-port 1111
Listening addresses:
  108.41.41.113:47896
  108.41.41.113:62424
  192.168.86.28:62424
DERP Region: 1
PeerID: msiymgtbgosahfrcftazqcbpz7n54z2kol2rd653fin6gh4remmq
```

Iroh has a default data directory, and a default port ([`1337`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet))

We pass `IROH_DATA_DIR=./` as an environment variable,

<Note>
  To make this more interesting, try running this step on a separate computer
  Iroh's networking stack will establish a connection for you.

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Protocol offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```text
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/sdks"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Check out our list of first-party SDKs"
  />
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```text {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api';

const client = new ApiClient(token);

await client.conversations.list();
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/conversations"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint"
  />
</div>

##  What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:

- Grab your API key from the Protocol dashboard](#)
- Check out the Conversations endpoint](/conversations)
- Learn about the different error messages in Protocol](/errors)
