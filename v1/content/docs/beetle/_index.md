# What is Beetle?

Beetle is a kubo-compatible implementation of the Interplanetary File System ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io)) for Cloud & Desktop platforms. We have Beetle parked in "maintenance mode" while we work on Iroh, our main IPFS implementation. We intend to come back to the Beetle project to build bridges from Kubo to Iroh in the future.

In the meantime, Beetle remains a working implementation of IPFS that interoperates with Kubo. More details can be found on our [Beetle Github Repo](https://github.com/n0-computer/beetle).
