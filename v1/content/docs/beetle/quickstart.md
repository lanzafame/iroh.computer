# Quickstart: Gateway

This guide will walk you through running iroh cloud on your local machine, using the default configuration of a gateway backed by a p2p and store service. Once a gateway is up & running we‚Äôll use it to fetch content from the IPFS network by requesting content from a web browser.

## Run Iroh locally

We‚Äôve prepped a bash file one-liner for you:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://sh.iroh.computer/setup.sh | sh -s -- quickstart
```

Running stuff from the internet directly on your terminal is generally a bad idea. Feel free to read through the script first üòÑ¬†by dropping the pipe `|` character and everything after it to print [`setup.sh`](https://sh.iroh.computer/setup.sh) to your terminal. The setup script takes a bit of time to fetch precompiled binaries. Once up and running you should see terminal output that looks like this:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://sh.iroh.computer/setup.sh | sh-s--quickstart

you can run iroh-ctl from ~/.iroh/bin/iroh-ctl
```

## Using the gateway

Open a web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:9050/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR?filename=test.jpg`. If working, you should see a funny looking ‚Äúcat‚Äù. If so, congrats! You‚Äôve used iroh to load something from the public IPFS network. If you reload this page that same content will be served from a local cache instead of hitting the network again. Feel free to experiment with other IPFS content!

## Hello iroh-ctl

Run `~/.iroh/bin/iroh-ctl status` to get a summary of the health of your iroh cloud services. You should see something like:

```
~/.iroh/bin/iroh-ctl status
Process     Number    Status
gateway     1/1       Serving
p2p         1/1       Serving
store       1/1       Serving
```

This indicates all three services are running & healthy.

## Stopping iroh

This setup script includes a few options, which you can see by replacing `quickstart` with `-h`:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://sh.iroh.computer/setup.sh | sh -s -- -h
iroh quickstart

USAGE:
    ./iroh.sh [COMMANDS] [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

COMMANDS:
    init          Initialize iroh
    start         Start iroh services
    stop          Stop iroh services
    quickstart    Init iroh and start services

FLAGS:
    -h, --help              Prints help information
```

The help text includes a reference to a `stop` command. Let‚Äôs run that:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://sh.iroh.computer/setup.sh | sh -s -- stop
```

You should see output looking like this:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://sh.iroh.computer/setup.sh | sh -s -- stop
stopping iroh-gateway...
stopping iroh-p2p...
stopping iroh-store...
```
